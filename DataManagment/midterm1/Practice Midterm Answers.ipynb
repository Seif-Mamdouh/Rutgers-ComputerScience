    "The answer consists of two functions, `count_words` and `organize_books`. These functions work together to organize a list of book filenames based on the number of words in each book in descending order. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n",

    "#### `count_words` Function:\n",
    "This function takes a filename as input and returns the number of words in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `def count_words(file_name):`: Defines a function called `count_words` that takes a single argument, `file_name`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `words = 0`: Initializes a variable `words` to store the word count, starting at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `with open(file_name, 'r') as file:`: Opens the file specified by `file_name` in read ('r') mode using a `with` statement. This ensures that the file is properly closed after reading, even if an exception occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `for line in file:`: Iterates through each line in the opened file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `line_words = line.strip().split()`: For each line, it removes leading and trailing whitespace using `strip()` and then splits the line into words using `split()`. The result is stored in the `line_words` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `words = words + len(line_words)`: Adds the number of words in the current line to the `words` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `return len(words)`: Returns the total word count in the given file as the output of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### `organize_books` Function:\n",
    "This function takes a list of book filenames and returns a sorted list of filenames based on the number of words in each book.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `def organize_books(books: list) -> list:`: Defines a function called `organize_books` that takes a list of filenames (`books`) as input and returns a list of filenames as output. The type hints indicate that `books` is expected to be a list, and the function returns a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `sorted_books = sorted(books, key=lambda book: count_words(book), reverse=True)`: Sorts the `books` list based on the number of words in each book. The `sorted` function is used with the `key` parameter, which specifies a function (`lambda book: count_words(book)`) to determine the sorting key. The `reverse=True` argument sorts the books in descending order (from most words to fewest words).\n",
